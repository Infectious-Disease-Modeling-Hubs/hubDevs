The goal of hubDevs is to provide utilities for creating and standardising Hubverse packages

## Installation

You can install the development version of hubDevs from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Infectious-Disease-Modeling-Hubs/hubDevs")
```

## Creating a hubverse package skeleton

First create a package skeleton.

This creates all basic infrastucture including a hubverse README and intiates the package as a git repository.

```{r example, eval=TRUE}
library(hubDevs)

temp_dir <- tempdir()
path <- fs::path(temp_dir, "testPkg")
create_hubdev_pkg(path)
```


```{r}
fs::dir_tree(path)
```


## Set up package on GitHub

Once the new package is launched, you can set it up on GitHub with:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
use_hubdev_github()
```

_Note: Your GitHub token must have rights to create a repository in the hubverse organisation for this to succeed._

The function runs a number of internal utilities for setting up a hubverse package on GitHub:

- Creates a repo in the hubverse GitHub organisation
- Adds details of the repository to the DESCRIPTION file
- Initailises pkgdown documentation
- Creates GitHub Action workflows for:
    - standard R CMD CHECK
    - test coverage
    - linting with `lintr`
    - building pkgdown documentation and deploying production docs to GitHub Pages
      and PR previews to a Netlify site
